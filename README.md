Terminate services without disabling them.

So one day I got tired of opening the services app and stopping services I didn't necessarily want to disable, but did want stopped to free up memory (for whatever game I was playing). I created a simple app to search all the system services for part of a description, display them, right click to terminate (or use a button to terminate them all).
